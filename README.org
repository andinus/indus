#+TITLE: Indus

Indus is a simple clipboard summarizer written in Go. It works by searching for
summary of text in clipboard & notifies the user about it.

* How is it useful?
I like the three finger tap feature on OSX, it pops up a little frame that shows
useful information on selected text. On my primary computer I have to select the
text, right click & choose "search with <search engine>". I wanted to make it
simpler so I made this tool. With this tool I just have to select the text, run
the command (binded to Mod+z) & it shows information on selected text as
notification.
