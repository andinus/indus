#+TITLE: Indus

Indus is a simple clipboard summarizer written in Go. It works by
searching for summary of text in clipboard & notifies the user about it.

* How is it useful?
I like the three finger tap feature on OSX, it pops up a little frame
that shows useful information on selected text. On my primary computer I
have to select the text, right click & choose "search with <search
engine>". I wanted to make it simpler so I made this tool. With this
tool I just have to select the text, run the command (binded to Mod+z) &
it shows information on selected text as notification.

*Note*: I'm using =wn= for this purpose now, I have a script that passes the
 clipboard to =wn=, which is a command line interface to WordNet's
 database. It's good enough for me, I'm not working on this project
 anymore.
